Service workers allow functionality to degrade gracefully in the absence of an internet connection or in low-network conditions. They enable features like offline browsing, background sync, and push notifications, which can enhance the user experience. Even if a browser does not support service workers, the application will still function but may lack some of the enhanced features, which also follows the core concept of graceful degradation.
